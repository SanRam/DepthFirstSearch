DepthFirstSearch
================

Depth First Search Algorithm implemented in C++.

1. Perform a depth-ﬁrst search of the graph. Your program should ask for the starting node.
2. Compute the discovery and ﬁnish times of the nodes.
3. Classify the edges (tree, back, ...) as early as possible instead of doing it after the DFS is fully done.
4. Check if the graph has cycles. In the case of directed graphs, ﬁnd a topological sort if one exists (i.e.,
if the graph is acyclic); in case the graph is acyclic, the program should compute a topological number
for the nodes and should print the nodes in a topologically sorted order.
5. If a directed graph has cycles, the program should ﬁnd the strongly connected components and print
the strongly connected components.
6. In the case of undirected graphs, check if the graph is connected, and print each connected component.
